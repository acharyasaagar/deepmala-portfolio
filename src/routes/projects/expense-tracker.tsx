              I started by conducting interviews, which helped me to create
              empathy maps to understand the needs of the users I am designing
              for. Research showed that, most of the people want to track their
              expenses to know where their money is going. However, study also
              finds out that most of the people feel, keeping the track of the
              expenses is time consuming as the process is long. People want to
              track their expenses in a very simple way, which takes few steps.

              This is my third project in UX Design, this is the project which I
              personally feel that this is the one I am looking for and the one
              I can use to record my daily expenses. So conducting usability
              studies and iteration of the appâ€™s designs many times, this is the
              high fidelity prototype I made.
